# weather_front_end
Website that that interacts with APIs to display weather information along with other related data (see:
  [The Router](https://github.com/chaseWilliams/router), which goes on to talk with
  [proxy-weather](https://github.com/chaseWilliams/proxy_weather) |
  [proxy-wikipedia](https://github.com/chaseWilliams/proxy_wikipedia) |
  [proxy-flickr](https://github.com/chaseWilliams/proxy_flickr))


This repo is temporarily deprecated until a workaround the XHR Cross-Origin Header error is found- for now, the static files are hosted at the router repo, where they share the same domain name.
